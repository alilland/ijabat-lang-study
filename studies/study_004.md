## "Christianity" Keyword Google Trends

Downloaded Data: [/data/google-trends/christianity](/data/google-trends/christianity)

After manually downloading Google Trend data using the keyword ["Christianity"](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fm%2F01lp8&date=now%201-d&geo=US&hl=en) between the dates of `2020-03-05`-`2025-03-05`, Google provided the "Top 25 Search Questions" it considers related to Christianity. The results are awful, and rarely related to Christianity at all, below is a curated list of questions that actually apply to Christianity.

We took each search term and normalized it into English using OpenAI in order for it to be scrutinized. If search results in the target nation were in English rather than their native languages, we automatically categorize it as none, because content in English is easily found and requires no translation work.

I am determining that its more advantageous to construct our own list of search terms, or to contact organizations which are better suited to provide this data. I dont expect Google to know when something is "Christian" or not.
